Raw Sockets vs Xlib/XCB
- Performance gains by using raw sockets over Xlib?
- XCB is badly documented.
- X protocol is easy.
- EUROPA uses very little of X protocol.
- Can eliminate dependencies of Xlib, Xexts, and XCB?
- GLX only works with Xlib? Does it use standard X protocol?
- Can we work around XSync() issue with raw server messages?

X11 Window Blitting Methods

XImage/XPutImage
- XSync() is maybe not necessary at all?
- Maybe provide the user an option to call XSync or not when swapping?
- All tests have succeeded with XPutImage without XSync() but need to test on
  more hardware.
- If XSync() is not necessary, XImage/XPutImage performs better than MIT-SHM in
  previous tests.
- Framerate limiting solves XSync() issue due to sleeping but not reliable?
- Maybe add a winsync() routine? Combining XSync() with framerate limiting is
  slow! Syncing outside of the frametime could help? Still want polling and
  swapping inside of frametime?

MIT-SHM/XShmPutImage
- Do not bother trying double buffering to eliminate XSync(). It works
  sometimes and other times it doesn't.
- Use when available? Provide option to enable at runtime? Performance gain is
  small due to XSync() requirement to prevent tearing. Need to test on better
  hardware.
- See XImage section above about XSync().
- Do MIT-SHM pixmaps have same issue?

GLX/glTexSubImage2D
- Seems like it would be faster than MIT-SHM or XImage on hardware with good
  graphics drivers/hardware. Provide an option in xwinsys?
- OpenGL calls needed are available since 2.1.
	- glTexSubImage2D might not perform well on old drivers/GPUs.
- glTexSubImage2D performs well on tested hardware.
	- Or is it optimized out without draw calls?
- Draw calls are bottleneck?
- No performance gain from simple shaders replacing fixed function pipeline
  on tested hardware.
- Probably should not be default but should be an option?
